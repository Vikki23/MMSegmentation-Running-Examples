# MMSegmentation-Running-Examples

Running examples of using mmsegmenation for image semantic segmentation

Materials are borrowed and rearranged from [MMSegmentation_Tutorial](https://github.com/TommyZihao/MMSegmentation_Tutorials.git) @TommyZihao

Run **MMSegmentation_running_examples.ipynb** in the colab. It includes:
1. MMSegmentation Installation
2. Making predictions with pretrained models
3. Training the model with own data
4. Testing the well-trained model

The auxiliary files would be used in `3. Training the model with own data`
